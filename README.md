# Financial & Predictive Models

This repository is dedicated to storing and organizing financial and predictive models that I develop as part of my financial analysis work.

## Folder Structure

- **Excel**: This folder contains Excel files with models built using spreadsheet formulas and features tailored for financial analysis.
- **Python**: Here, you'll find Python scripts and notebooks that implement advanced data analysis and predictive modeling techniques.

Each subfolder is organized to facilitate easy access and management of models based on the tools used for their creation.

Feel free to explore the models and utilize them for enhancing your financial analytics capabilities.
